Please email the list if you have questions or error reports; the [Librelist homepage](http://librelist.com/) has more information about this process.  You can also file issues for each of the individual projects:\r\n* [Core Econometrics text issues](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/GraduateText/issues)\r\n* [Graduate Macroeconometrics text issues](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/MacroeconometricsText/issues)\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to contribute to this project.  I plan to eventually add an IRC channel, but the project isn't large enough to justify it yet.\r\n\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThis organization was started on April 29, 2013 by @gcalhoun; you can find more information at the organization page on GitHub: @EconometricsLibrary.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
