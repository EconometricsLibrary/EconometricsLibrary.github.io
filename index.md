The *Econometrics Free Library Project* aims to produce free and open
access econometrics texts suitable for graduate education; all of the
texts can be modified and redistributed under the
[GNU Free Documentation License][FDL].

This project started in April, 2013, and we are writing its first
book, a textbook for the first semester of the PhD core econometrics
sequence.  More information about this book can be found at the
following links:

* [the book][pdf], version 0.7.1 (pdf); also [release notes and old
  versions][old].
* [textbook homepage](/core)
* [source code repository][git-core]

Follow the [EFLP newsfeed](/blog) ([<ac>rss</ac>](/rss.xml)) for
updates.

Getting involved
----------------

This is meant to be a community project, so your contributions are
welcome.  We need people to edit and review the ongoing *Core
Econometrics* text, please go to [its homepage](/core) for more
information if you are interested.  We would also be elated to help
anyone working on their own free and open access textâ€”just email the
mailing list for more information.

The project mailing list is <econometricslibrary@librelist.com> and is
for discussion of both the Econometrics Free Library Project in
general and the *Core Econometrics* text.  Please email the list if you
have questions or find errors in any of the texts; the [Librelist
homepage][i] has more information about this process.  Please note
that your first email subscribes you to the list but is discarded.
The [list archives][j] are available online as well.

The main GitHub page for this project is [EconometricsLibrary][k].

External resources
------------------

There are other sources of free econometrics material. This is an
incomplete list of some that stand out. These links are provided for
your convenience (and ours), but we do not maintain these
documents. Please contact the original authors to report errors, etc.

Also, please contact the project mailing list if you know of other
