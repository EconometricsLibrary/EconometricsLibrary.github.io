Summary
-------

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain free and open
access econometrics texts suitable for graduate education. Everything
will be available for free under the [GNU Free Documentation
License][FDL], which means that you can download the LaTeX source code
as well as pdfs of the texts and edit and redistribute them.  Please
[read the license][FDL] first, though, because it applies to any
copies that you redistribute as well.

Texts under development (pre-alpha)
-----------------------------------

The main text under developement is [Core Econometrics Notes][b],
currently a collection of disorganized notes for a first-semester PhD
econometrics core class.  The document is split into four pdfs; the
most recent versions are:
1. [Probability overview][core1]
2. [Finite sample inference][core2]
3. [Asymptotic theory][core3]
4. [Linear regression][core4]

You can download [older versions of the pdfs][g] as well.

You can track this book's development at its [GitHub page][b] or
through [this newsfeed][coreatom]. If you find errors in the text,
please [email the project mailing list][maillist], or add the error to
the [bug tracker][bugs].

Getting involved
----------------

This is meant to be a community project, so your contributions are
welcome.  The source code for *Core Econometrics Notes* is available
on GitHub at
<https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText> and you
are free to download and modify it.  The [README file][a2] has
directions on generating pdfs from the LaTeX source.

Finding and reporting errors is enormously helpful.  When you find
them, please [email the mailing list][maillist] or [add the error to
the project's bug tracker][bugs].

If you would like to help any other way, please email the project
mailing list, <econometricslibrary@librelist.com>.  We are in the
process of writing a more detailed guide and will post it when it is
finished.
