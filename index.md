The *Econometrics Free Library Project* aims to produce free and open
access econometrics texts suitable for graduate education; all of the
texts can be modified and redistributed under the
[GNU Free Documentation License][FDL].

This project started in April, 2013, and we are writing its first
book, a textbook for the first semester of the PhD core econometrics
sequence.  More information about this book can be found at the
following links:

* [the book][pdf], version 0.7.1 (pdf); also [release notes and old
  versions][old].
* [textbook homepage](/core)
* [source code repository][git-core]

Getting involved
----------------

This is meant to be a community project, so your contributions are
welcome.  We need people to edit and review the ongoing *Core
Econometrics* text, please go to [its homepage](/core) for more
information if you are interested.  We would also be elated to help
anyone working on their own free and open access textâ€”just email the
mailing list for more information.

The project mailing list is <econometricslibrary@librelist.com> and is
for discussion of both the Econometrics Free Library Project in
general and the *Core Econometrics* text.  Please email the list if you
have questions or find errors in any of the texts; the [Librelist
homepage][i] has more information about this process.  Please note
that your first email subscribes you to the list but is discarded.
The [list archives][j] are available online as well.

The main GitHub page for this project is [EconometricsLibrary][k].
