title: "Why the GNU FDL?  Why not Creative Commons?"
---

The [GNU Free Documentation License][FDL] requires that anyone who
distributes these texts also make available a human-editable version.
[Creative Commons][CC] licenses do not.  This distinction is not
important for many documents, but it is for mathematically-dense
textbooks (among others)â€”without the LaTeX source code, it would be
prohibitively difficult for others to edit these documents, so we
use a license that makes the source code available.
