The project's mailing list is now available through [Gmane][];
information is [available here][a]. This gives us another copy of the
archives, but it also provides more functionality:

* You can subscribe to an RSS feed of messages to the mailing list. (I
  recommend [newsbeuter][].)

* You can read the messages in a dedicated newsreader. (I recommend
  [slrn][].)

You may notice a preference for text-based readers. Please take that
as a hint and use old-fashioned [email netiquette][b] when you post to
the list. (Top 3 in order: bottom posting, plain-text messages, and 72
character lines.)
