title: First post and status update

We've restyled the project's homepage and added a newsfeed.  So I
should probably post some news.

The [*Core Econometrics* notes](/core) have been progressing pretty
well.  I've been using them as lecture notes as I teach graduate
econometrics this Fall and have been updating them before and after
lecture.  About 2/3 of it have been converted from a loose and
inaccurate outline into a slightly less loose and slightly less
inaccurate collection of ordered paragraphs.

We're currently at version 0.5.0 and you can download pdfs
[here][pdfs].

Next on the horizon:

* I'm teaching linear regression next, so that material (part 4 of the
  text) will be updated.  There's a lot to do with that material,
  though, so there will still be a lot left to do at the end of the
  semester.

* I'd like to write detailed directions on "how to contribute" on the
  off chance that there's someone out there who wants to contribute
  but doesn't know how.

Also: you might have noticed that I've taken down the
Macroeconometrics text.  It's still on my [personal github
page][grayclhn], but I wasn't updating it *at all* and it was in a
pretty crappy state to begin with.  I'll put it back when I get a
chance to work on it some more, and if anyone would like to use it as
a starting point for his or her own work, feel free.

Stay tuned.  I'll try to post updates here as we go.
