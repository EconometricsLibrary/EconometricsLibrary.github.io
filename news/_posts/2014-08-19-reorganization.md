title: Massive website and project reorganization
author: Gray Calhoun
---

We’ve reorganized the project homepage to reflect a change in
direction. We’re going to emphasize existing free econometrics
resources and deëmphasize our own text, mostly because we haven’t been
able to spend as much time developing it as we’d like.

The resources are listed on [the homepage](/) and include textbooks,
lecture videos from the NBER Summer Institute, and self-contained
course lecture notes.
