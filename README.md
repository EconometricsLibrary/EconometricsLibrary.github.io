Webpage for the Econometrics Free Library
=========================================


The goal of this organization is to produce and maintain a set of up-to-date Econometrics texts suitable for graduate education, available for free under the [GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

Texts under development (pre-alpha)
-----------------------------------

* [Core Econometrics Text](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/GraduateText), disorganized notes for a first-semester PhD econometrics core class.
* [Graduate Macroeconometrics](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/MacroeconometricsText), at the moment, a disorganized set of partial lecture notes for a PhD time-series elective.

Support or Contact
------------------

We have a mailing list: <econometricslibrary@librelist.com>.  Please email the list if you have questions or error reports; the [Librelist homepage](http://librelist.com/) has more information about this process.  You can also file issues for each of the individual projects:
* [Core Econometrics text issues](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/GraduateText/issues)
* [Graduate Macroeconometrics text issues](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/MacroeconometricsText/issues)

Please subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to contribute to this project.  I plan to eventually add an IRC channel, but the project isn't large enough to justify it yet.
