Econometrics free library project
=================================

The *Econometrics Free Library Project* aims to distribute free and
open access econometrics texts suitable for graduate
education. Although the original plan was to produce these texts
ourselves, time constraints have made that impractical, so we’ll
focus on curation. (“We” is one tenure-track professor.)

Support or Contact
------------------

We have a mailing list: <econometricslibrary@librelist.com>.  Please
email the list if you have questions or error reports; the [Librelist
homepage](http://librelist.com/) has more information about this
process; [list archives are available online as
well](http://librelist.com/browser/econometricslibrary/).

Please subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to contribute to
this project. I plan to eventually add an IRC channel, but the project
isn't large enough to justify it yet.
