Econometrics free library project
=================================


The goal of this project is to produce and maintain up-to-date Econometrics texts suitable for graduate education and available for free under the [GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

Texts under development (pre-alpha)
-----------------------------------

* [Core Econometrics Notes](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText), disorganized notes for a first-semester PhD econometrics core class.

Support or Contact
------------------

We have a mailing list: <econometricslibrary@librelist.com>.  Please email the list if you have questions or error reports; the [Librelist homepage](http://librelist.com/) has more information about this process; [list archives are available online as well](http://librelist.com/browser/econometricslibrary/).  You can also file issues for individual projects:
* [Core Econometrics Notes issues](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText/issues)

Please subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to contribute to this project.  I plan to eventually add an IRC channel, but the project isn't large enough to justify it yet.
