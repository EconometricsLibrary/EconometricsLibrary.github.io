This website has links to free econometrics resources, with a
preference for explicitly open-access resources where possible. We
will also try to announce updates to those resources via our:

* Mailing list: <econometricslibrary@librelist.com>
  (archived at [Gmane][a4] and [librelist][a2])
* [RSS feed](/rss.xml)
* [News page](/news)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EconometricsLib)

You can subscribe to the RSS feed with any newsreader.

To subscribe to the mailing list, simply send an email to
<econometricslibrary@librelist.com>. It’s a discussion list, so any
future messages will go to all of the subscribers. (Your signup email
is dropped.) The [Librelist homepage][a1] has more information about
their mailing list service.

It’s worth emphasizing: we want to respect every author’s
copyright. Where possible, we’d like to host a local copy of all of
the resources listed here to mitigate linkrot, but if we have
misinterpreted your license or your intent, please email the project
mailing list and we will happily remove it.

Also note that, if we host or link to a resource, it in no way implies
that the author of that resource endorses this project.
